Recent advances in machine learning have the potential to revolutionize genomics through deep learning, improved phylogenetic inference and multivariate Bayesian methods. The Vancouver Machine Learning: Genomics (VanML: Genomics) is a small and focused conference, and will be held a few days after the famous Neural Information and Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2019 conference and Machine Learning in Computational Biology workshop. It will bring together top researchers in a range of biostatistical fields including population genetics, phylogenetics, pathogen studies and proteomics. The speakers and attendees include top researchers from the co-located NeurIPS and the Machine Learning in Computational Biology (MLCB) conferences.
      </p></p>
      
      <p style="line-height: 1.25;">
        The Vancouver Macine Learning conference is organised by Caroline Colijn (caroline &#x5f; colijn &#x1612; sfu &#x1427; ca) in the Department of Mathematics and Lloyd Elliott (lloyd &#x5F; elliott &#x1612; sfu &#x1427; ca) in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at Simon Fraser University. The conference will be held as a one day conference on <b>December 16th</b> at the Harbour Centre, the first Monday after the NeurIPS 2019 workshops. The venue is the Harbour Centre, which is located in downtown Vancouver and a short walk from the Hyatt Regency hotel and the Vancouver Convention Centre. We have 5 confirmed speakers (listed below). Our sponsors are the
        <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/vpresearch/contact.html">Office of the Vice-President, Research</a>,
        and the
